# machine_learning_RNN_bike_data

Using the extensive machine learning infrastructure available in python, three different Recurrent Neural Network frameworks were used an a Bike rental data to compare performance of these frameworks based on predictive accuracy in order to better advise on which to use on a similar dataset.
